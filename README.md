# playscrapingnodejs
This is a simple Node.js script I wrote in July 2014.
It scrapes stats of three specific athletes on espn.go.com. 
It was my first time ever coding with JavaScript, and also my first time using Node.js. 
I may get back to this at some point and revise some things in here, but I keep it here as an example of scraping with JavaScript and Node.js.
